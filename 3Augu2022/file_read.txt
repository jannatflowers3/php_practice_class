If you’d like certain tags to be ignored, include them in the
allowable_tags
parameter. Please note that the allowed tags might contain JavaScript code that could be
harmfull if the content is served back to the users as part of the website. If user-provided
content is served back to the website. the HTML should be stripped out or converted to
HTML entites so they are shown as types and not parsed (executed) as HTML/JavaScript
by the browser. As an example, consider a scenario in which contributors are expected to
submit their work in HTML format using a specified subset of HTML tags. Of course, the
contributors don’t always follow instructions, so the file must be filtered for tag misuse
before it can be published. With
fgetss()
, this is trivia
